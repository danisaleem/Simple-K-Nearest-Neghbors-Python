A simple python script that implements K Nearest Neghbors Algorithm (With manual K as well as input from user)

#  What is K Nearest Neighbors
K nearest neighbors is a simple algorithm that stores all available cases and classifies new cases based on a similarity measure (e.g., distance functions). KNN has been used in statistical estimation and pattern recognition already in the beginning of 1970â€™s as a non-parametric technique
